Presentation
"lab 4" 	shows the basic strip chart function for 75%
"lab 4 extra 1" shows the fahrenheith measurement of the temperature
"lab 4 extra 2" shows the timer measurement displaying the lowest, highest and average calue aquired whtin the inputted interval. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic:
Measure the temperature from LM335 and display a live stripchart on python.
*Strip chart in the demo is enlarged to make the functionality more visible. In the source code, 
it is in the range of the chip(-40~100).

Additonal Functionalities:
1. A flexible interface that allows the user to choose between different measurements. 

2. Regular temperature measurements
	Allow the user to set temperature unit (degree or fahrenheit).

3. Timer temperature measurments
	Allow the user to set a time interval and display the lowest, highest and average within the interval.
