Basic:
	The  voltmeter  takes  the  two  analog  inputs:  the  reference  input  and  the  test  input.  
	Display,  using  an  LCD,  the  magnitude  of  both  inputs  in  volts  RMS,  and  the  phase 
	difference between the reference and test signals in degrees.


Additonal:
	Interface that allows the user to navigate between different functionalities just like a multimeter. 
	The output is displayed both in the console and the LCD display on breadboard. 

	Functions include:
	1. Voltmeter 		displaying Vref, V and Vdiff.
	2. Frequency Meter 	displaying the frequency of the two inputs.
	3. Thermometer 		displaying the temperature in degrees. 


Demonstration:	

	Wave set 1: 
	A1 = 4, A2 = 1
	f = 60, phasor = 30

	Wave set 2:
	A1 = 2, A2 = 3
	f = 50, phasor = 40

	Interface Demo:
	Conducted with wave set 1
	-> Flash 
	-> Press 'reset' button to start the software
	-------Loop-------
	-> Start function from the main menu by pressing according number (1~4) in the keyboard
	-> Press 'Enter' to run the function. Repeat several times to show that not LCD display is also updating
	   simulatenously with the console. 
	-> Input random things to test the interface
	-> Press 'Enter' again to run the function again after a random input
	-> Press 'ESC' to exit the program and go back to the main menu
	-> Start function from the main menu by pressing according number (1~4) in the keyboard
