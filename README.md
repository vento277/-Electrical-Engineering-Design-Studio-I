# Design Studio I
Electrical project studio where one designs a series of electronic applications using AT89LP51RC2 microcontroller and others for things such as alarm clocks, thermometers and coin picking robots.

## LCD Display
Displays the name and student number on an LCD display. As an additional feature, is consists of cursors and graphics such as: incremental display, special characters and scroll. 

## ISR
Building a digital alarm clock, where the user can set the time & alarm with pushbuttons. As an additional feature, the user is allowed to change the date, and use a stopwatch function built within the clock. 

## LM555
Building a capacitance meter with the LM555 chip. As an additional feature, it measures the impedance and the resistance, performing more like a multimeter.

## LM355
Building a thermometer using the LM355 chip. As an additional function, an interface is provided to allow the user an option of:

Set temperature unit. 

Set an interval of measurement.  

Set an interval of measurement and get the lowest, highest, and average of the measured temperature within that interval

## Phasor
Building a phasor meter. As an additional function, an interface is provided to allow the user an option of:

Voltmeter

Frequency Meter

Thermometer
