# Design Studio I
2nd year electrical engineering project course offered by the University of British Columbia. 

*Course Descrption: Design projects involving electronic devices and circuits, electromagnetics, signals and systems, and microcomputers.*

## Group Projects - Capacitor Game & Coin Picking Robot
Information provided in the project specific folder. 

## LCD Display
Displays the name and student number on an LCD display. As an additional feature, is consists of cursors and graphics such as: incremental display, special characters and scroll. 

## ISR - Alarm Clock
Building a digital alarm clock, where the user can set the time & alarm with pushbuttons. As an additional feature, the user is allowed to change the date, and use a stopwatch function built within the clock. 

## LM555 - Multimeter
Building a capacitance meter with the LM555 chip. As an additional feature, it measures the impedance and the resistance, performing more like a multimeter.

## LM355 - Thermometer
Building a thermometer using the LM355 chip. As an additional function, an interface is provided to allow the user an option of:

Set temperature unit. 

Set an interval of measurement.  

Set an interval of measurement and get the lowest, highest, and average of the measured temperature within that interval

## Phasor - Multimeter 2
Building a phasor meter. As an additional function, an interface is provided to allow the user an option of:

Voltmeter

Frequency Meter

Thermometer
