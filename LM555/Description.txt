The basic code is from the given example 'Period_RC2_overflow.asm' and 'Freq_RC2_overflow.asm'.

Functionality includes:
Measuring period (given)
Measuring capacitance
# Measuring impedance
# Measuring resistance	*Used 0.1uF capacitor as a set variable. 
			 My meter is not set to detect 0.1uF, as a result, the impedance caluclation is invalid.
