# Project 2 - Coin Picking Robot
Objective: Design, build, program, and test a robot that detects coins.  operates within a predefined perimeter of a current-carrying wire. 

## Project Requirements

1. Microcontroller system other than 8051
2. Battery Operated
3. Metal Detection
4. Coin Picking Mechanism
5. Robot Construction
6. C
7. MOSFET drivers
8. Perimeter Wire Generator
9. Pick up at least 20 coins

## Robot Design 

SAMD20E16 controlled robot detects and picks up 20 randomly placed Canadian coins within a physical perimeter that is set using a current-carrying wire. Additionally, it displays the number of trials the robot has attempted to pick up the coins as a binary number using the 4 color-coded LED.
